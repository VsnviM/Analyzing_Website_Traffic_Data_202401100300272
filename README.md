# Website Traffic Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes website traffic data using Python. We extract meaningful insights by processing a dataset 
containing page views, session durations, bounce rates, and traffic sources.

## Requirements
- Python 
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Place your dataset (`traffic_data.csv`) in the same directory.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook `Vaishnavi_202401100300272.ipynb`.
4. Run all the cells to generate insights and visualizations.

## Output
The notebook generates various charts, including:
- Website traffic trends over time.
- Traffic source distribution.
- Bounce rate analysis.
- Average session duration by day.
